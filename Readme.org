* Redux in angular presentation
This is a presentation of the redux applied
architecture when working in Angular projects.

* Tooling
** Easy view creation
   If you choose to create views without dependencies
   (just @Input and @Output) there is a good project
   for handling the workflow
   [[https://storybook.js.org][Storybook]]
** State view and representation
   Choose a browser and Install the Redux DevTools for it.

** Immutability handling
   When working with data in a redux workflow, you must use
   immutable objects frequently.
   There is some libraries for it:
*** My favourite one (plain objects, easier to manage)
    [[https://github.com/kolodny/immutability-helper][Immutability helper]]
*** A high rated one (own structures, could cause some troubles)

** Easing action creation and handling (don't use it if you already don't understand the workflow)
